  Windows Batch Examples
</h1>

This is a simple repo with two simple Window's batch examples.

One batch file will open Youtube.com in a browser window.

The second batch file will sort items in a folder into folders based on extension. For example, all png files will be placed in one file, all jpg files will be placed in a folder, and so on.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

Simply clone this repo, or you may copy and paste the code into a notepad or text editor or your choice. Make sure that the extension on the file is set to .bat.

To run the first batch file, simply double click and it should run. 

For the second batch file, place into a folder of your choosing, double click, and wait a moment for execution.
